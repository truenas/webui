 * Providers required when a component under test renders `<ix-form>`. Supplies
 * mocks for the services IxFormComponent injects internally (error handling,
 * snackbar) plus `SlideIn` — the embedded `<ix-modal-header>` reads
 * `SlideIn.openSlideIns()` (the signal that counts currently-open slide-ins)
 * to compute its overlay-position tooltip; without this mock, tests would
 * crash trying to call `.openSlideIns()` on an undefined service.
 *
 * Returned as a factory so each test gets its own `jest.fn()` for
 * `openSlideIns` — avoids shared call counts leaking between tests.
