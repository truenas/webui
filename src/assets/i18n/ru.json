  "Changes to ACL type affect how on-disk ZFS ACL is  written and read.\nWhen the ACL type is changed from POSIX to NFSv4,  no migration is performed for default and access ACLs encoded in the  posix1e acl extended attributes to native ZFS ACLs.\nWhen ACL type is  changed from NFSv4 to POSIX, native ZFS ACLs are not converted to  posix1e extended attributes, but the native ACL will be used internally  by ZFS for access checks.\n\nThis means that the user must manually set  new ACLs recursively on the dataset after ACL type changes in order to  avoid unexpected permissions behavior.\n\nThis action will be destructive,  and so it is advised to take a ZFS snapshot of the dataset prior to ACL  type changes and permissions modifications.": "Изменения в типе ACL влияют на то, как записывается и считывается ACL ZFS на диске.\nКогда тип ACL изменяется с POSIX на NFSv4, миграция не выполняется для списков ACL по умолчанию и доступа, закодированных в расширенных атрибутах posix1e acl, к собственным ACL ZFS.\nПри изменении типа ACL с NFSv4 на POSIX собственные ACL ZFS не преобразуются в расширенные атрибуты posix1e, но собственный ACL будет использоваться внутри ZFS для проверки доступа.\n\nЭто означает, что пользователь должен вручную устанавливать новые ACL рекурсивно в наборе данных после изменения типа ACL, чтобы избежать неожиданного поведения разрешений.\n\nЭто действие будет разрушительным, поэтому рекомендуется сделать снимок набора данных ZFS до изменения типа ACL и разрешений.",

  "Determine how  <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/chmod.1.html\" target=\"_blank\">chmod</a>  behaves when adjusting file ACLs. See the  <a href=\"https://linux.die.net/man/8/zfs\" target=\"_blank\">zfs(8)</a> aclmode property.  <br><br><i>Passthrough</i> only updates ACL entries that are related to the file or directory mode.  <br><br><i>Restricted</i> does not allow chmod to make changes to files or directories with a  non-trivial ACL. An ACL is trivial if it can be fully expressed as a file mode without losing  any access rules. Setting the ACL Mode to Restricted is typically used to optimize a dataset for  SMB sharing, but can require further optimizations. For example, configuring an rsync task with this  dataset could require adding <i>--no-perms</i> in the task <i>Auxiliary Parameters</i> field.": "Определяет поведение <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/chmod.1.html\" target=\"_blank\">chmod</a> при настройке файловых ACL. См. свойство <a href=\"https://linux.die.net/man/8/zfs\" target=\"_blank\">zfs(8)</a> aclmode. <br><br><i>Passthrough</i> обновляет только те записи ACL, которые связаны с режимом файла или каталога. <br><br><i>Restricted</i> не позволяет chmod вносить изменения в файлы или каталоги с нетривиальным ACL. ACL является тривиальным, если он может быть полностью выражен как режим файла без потери каких-либо правил доступа. Установка режима ACL в Restricted обычно используется для оптимизации набора данных для совместного использования по SMB, но может потребовать дальнейших оптимизаций. Например, настройка задачи rsync с этим набором данных может потребовать добавления параметра <i>--no-perms</i> в поле <i>Вспомогательные параметры</i> задачи. ",
