  "Changes to ACL type affect how on-disk ZFS ACL is  written and read.\nWhen the ACL type is changed from POSIX to NFSv4,  no migration is performed for default and access ACLs encoded in the  posix1e acl extended attributes to native ZFS ACLs.\nWhen ACL type is  changed from NFSv4 to POSIX, native ZFS ACLs are not converted to  posix1e extended attributes, but the native ACL will be used internally  by ZFS for access checks.\n\nThis means that the user must manually set  new ACLs recursively on the dataset after ACL type changes in order to  avoid unexpected permissions behavior.\n\nThis action will be destructive,  and so it is advised to take a ZFS snapshot of the dataset prior to ACL  type changes and permissions modifications.": "Zmiany typu ACL wpływają na sposób zapisywania i odczytywania ACL w systemie plików ZFS.\nGdy typ ACL zostanie zmieniony z POSIX na NFSv4, nie zostanie przeprowadzona migracja domyślnych i dostępowych ACL zapisanych w rozszerzonych atrybutach posix1e do natywnych ACL ZFS.\nGdy typ ACL zostanie zmieniony z NFSv4 na POSIX, natywne ACL ZFS nie zostaną przekonwertowane na rozszerzone atrybuty posix1e, ale nadal będą używane wewnętrznie przez ZFS do kontroli dostępu.\n\nOznacza to, że użytkownik musi ręcznie ustawić nowe ACL na datasetach rekursywnie po zmianie typu ACL, aby uniknąć nieoczekiwanych problemów z uprawnieniami.\n\nTa operacja jest destrukcyjna, dlatego zaleca się wykonanie migawki ZFS przed zmianą typu ACL i modyfikacją uprawnień.",

An ACL is trivial if it can be fully expressed as a file mode without losing  any access rules.

ACL jest trywialny, jeśli może być w pełni wyrażony jako tryb pliku bez utraty jakichkolwiek reguł dostępu. Ustawienie trybu ACL na Restricted jest zwykle używane do optymalizacji zestawu danych dla współdzielenia SMB, ale może wymagać dalszych optymalizacji.
