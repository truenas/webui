The usage restriction might be employed when a key that  could be used for more than one operation is to be restricted. For  example, when an RSA key should be used only to verify signatures on  objects other than public key certificates and CRLs, the <i>Digital Signature</i>  bits would be asserted. Likewise, when an RSA key should be used only for key  management, the <i>Key Encipherment</i> bit would be asserted. <br>  See <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt\">RFC 3280, section 4.2.1.3</a>  for more information.": "Activá esta extensión de certificado. La extensión de uso de clave define el propósito (por ejemplo, cifrado, firma, firma de certificado) de la clave contenida en el certificado. La restricción de uso se puede emplear cuando se debe restringir una clave que se puede utilizar para más de una operación. Por ejemplo, cuando una clave RSA se debe utilizar solo para verificar firmas en objetos que no sean certificados de clave pública y listas de revocación de certificados (CRL), se van a activar los bits de <i>Firma digital</i>. Del mismo modo, cuando una clave RSA se debe utilizar solo para la gestión de claves, se va a activar el bit de <i>Cifrado de clave</i>. <br> Consultá la <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt\">RFC 3280, sección 4.2.1.3</a> para obtener más información.",

  "Changes to ACL type affect how on-disk ZFS ACL is  written and read.\nWhen the ACL type is changed from POSIX to NFSv4,  no migration is performed for default and access ACLs encoded in the  posix1e acl extended attributes to native ZFS ACLs.\nWhen ACL type is  changed from NFSv4 to POSIX, native ZFS ACLs are not converted to  posix1e extended attributes, but the native ACL will be used internally  by ZFS for access checks.\n\nThis means that the user must manually set  new ACLs recursively on the dataset after ACL type changes in order to  avoid unexpected permissions behavior.\n\nThis action will be destructive,  and so it is advised to take a ZFS snapshot of the dataset prior to ACL  type changes and permissions modifications.": "Los cambios en el tipo de ACL afectan la forma en que se escribe y lee la ACL de ZFS en el disco.\nCuando el tipo de ACL se cambia de POSIX a NFSv4, no se realiza ninguna migración de las ACL predeterminadas y de acceso codificadas en los atributos extendidos de ACL posix1e a las ACL nativas de ZFS.\nCuando el tipo de ACL se cambia de NFSv4 a POSIX, las ACL nativas de ZFS no se convierten en atributos extendidos posix1e, pero ZFS va a usar la ACL nativa internamente para las verificaciones de acceso.\n\nEsto significa que el usuario debe configurar manualmente las nuevas ACL de forma recursiva en el conjunto de datos después de los cambios en el tipo de ACL para evitar un comportamiento inesperado de los permisos.\n\nEsta acción va a ser destructiva, por lo que se recomienda tomar una instantánea de ZFS del conjunto de datos antes de los cambios en el tipo de ACL y las modificaciones de permisos.",
