The usage restriction might be employed when a key that  could be used for more than one operation is to be restricted. For  example, when an RSA key should be used only to verify signatures on  objects other than public key certificates and CRLs, the <i>Digital Signature</i>  bits would be asserted. Likewise, when an RSA key should be used only for key  management, the <i>Key Encipherment</i> bit would be asserted. <br>  See <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt\">RFC 3280, section 4.2.1.3</a>  for more information.": "",
