TrueNAS WebUI
================
[![Latest Docker Image - master](https://github.com/truenas/webui/actions/workflows/docker_latest.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/truenas/webui/actions/workflows/docker_latest.yml)


This is the project for the Angular.io WebUI for TrueNAS CORE & TrueNAS SCALE.

# Testing Images

You can download and test running the latest version of the TrueNAS WebUI anytime using pre-built docker images.

Images only require the environment variable TNIP to be set to the IP or Hostname of your local TrueNAS instance.

Example:

```sh
$ docker container run -it -e TNIP=192.168.0.30 -p 8080:80 ixsystems/truenas-webui:latest
```

This would allow you to access the running WebUI on http://localhost:8080

NOTE: Pull requests are also generated as Docker images and can be used for testing by replacing the ":latest" tag with the pull-request ID. I.E. "ixsystems/truenas-webui:5010"

# Development requirements

  - yarn >= 1.22
  - Node.js >= 18.19.1
  - Running TrueNAS CORE or TrueNAS SCALE Nightly Machine (VM is fine)


# Getting started

Have a system with yarn.

Checkout TrueNAS git repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/truenas/webui.git
$ cd webui
```

Install yarn packages:

```sh
$ yarn install
```

Generate an environment file

```sh
$ yarn check-env
```

Configure the remote TrueNAS system you'd like to connect to.
(if your ip address changes later you may repeat this step)

```sh
$ yarn ui remote -i <ip address or FQDN of the server where TrueNAS is running>
```
NOTE: It is highly recommended to create an alias in your shell of choice to 'ui' to minimize typing
If this script gives a typescript error in the console, please see the section above on generating an environment file

zsh example: `alias ui='yarn run --silent ui`

## Starting the Application

To start run

```sh
yarn start
```

This runs a local webserver with the new WebUI, by default at http://localhost:4200.
If this webserver is kept running, changes to the project will be rebuilt incrementally.

To run the production build, run

```sh
yarn run build:prod:aot
```

Getting errors about missing packages?

```sh
yarn install
```

Getting permission errors or Failed messages when trying to run `yarn start`?

From the webui repo

```sh
rm -rf node_modules (may need root)
rm yarn.lock
yarn cache clean --force
yarn install
```

This should bring the yarn environment back to a usable state.
