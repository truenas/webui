## Validating Your Changes

We have a automated CI process setup which gets run on every PR. You must pass all of the checks for us to consider merging your PR. The checks make sure that all of the unit tests pass on your PR and that it builds successfully. Furthermore, multiple linter rules are enabled on the repo to ensure that the code is up to the format standards that we would like to keep in our project. If the linter sees issues in your project, it might ask you to remove those issues before you can make a commit.
