## Raising Issues

Feel free to raise an issue if you have a question, an enhancement, or a bug report.

You can raise issues by either creating a ticket on our Jira (https://jira.ixsystems.net) or by creating a PR with a detailed description of the current behavior and the expected behavior after the suggested fix.

While raising an issue on Jira, please provide as much information as possible. Add screenshots and attached a debug file which you can get from your truenas 

Before creating a new ticket, user keywords to search if a duplicated issue has already been raised. In which case, you can show your interest in the ticket by commenting under it.

You can easily contribute to our project by creating a fork or a new branch. After committing your changes, you can create a PR. PR's require at least one approved review from a member of the UI Team before they can be merged. When you create a new PR, someone from the UI team is automatically requested for a PR review. Alternatively, you can ask for a review from @truenas/ui_team.

Once your PR has been approved, your PR can be merged. Depending on the project status, merge actions might be restricted to authorized individuals only. In which case, approved PRs will be automatically merged in due time.
