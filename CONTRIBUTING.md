# Contributing

You can easily contribute to our project by creating a fork or a new branch. After committing your changes, you can create a PR. PR's require at least one approved review from a member of the UI Team before they can be merged. When you create a new PR, someone from the UI team is automatically requested for a PR review. Alternatively, you can ask for a review from @truenas/ui_team.

Once your PR has been approved, your PR can be merged. Depending on the project status, merge actions might be restricted to authorized individuals only. In which case, approved PRs will be automatically merged in due time.
